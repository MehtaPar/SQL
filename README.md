# SQL
A repository of sample SQL code to re-strengthen my understanding of it. Each file does some sort of basic function or task.
These sql commands are being run in MYSQL workbench.

The files are named to tell what commands they do. Example, AppDelCol.sql appends and deletes columns from a table. 
Currently there is a database called game_company that has games and consoles

The order they are being added to follow along with the progress is

1. CreateShowDelete.sql    creates, outputs and deletes a database.
2. CreateTableCols.sql     creates table columns.
3. AppDelCol.sql           creates and appends a table by altering the table 
4. ForeignKey.sql          creates the console table and adds a foreign key to the game table connecting the two tables.
